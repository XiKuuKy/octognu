octognu
=========

install
----------

Install slpkg with `installpkg slpkg*`

Then install all the other stuff.

Copy the .pekwm folder to your home folder. Then run `mmaker pekwm -f`. Change the `~/.pekwm/start` to reflect your background (I used a picture of the girl group TWICE :* )

Recommendations
---------------
change your shell to `mksh`. Try `jupp` as opposed to Vim or Emacs. I also recommend you run `slpkg -s sbo termite`. `mpv` is recommended.
